3) Run npm start to start the backend which will run on port 3000

*FIRING UP THE FRONTEND*

TASK C

1) How long did this assignment take you and where did you spend your time?

It took me 6.5 hours to complete the whole assessment. I spent about 3 hours working on the styling (which is not my strong point). I was trying to get my application to look like the images given as examples.

Due to how much time I spent on the styling, I did not get to do any error handling or refactoring of the initial code I wrote when I started.

2) What would you do differently or improve in your submission?

Instead of spending most of my time trying to get the project to look exactly like the example. I would try to work more on the functionality (error handling) of the project, which I feel is a bit more important than how it looks.
